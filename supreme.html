				<h2 id="manual">How to manually buy Supreme</h2>
				<p>
					To buy Supreme items manually means to buy them without any automated software, aka bots. If you have not determined which items you will buy, check out the paragraph where we walk you through it on our <a href="home.html#determinesupremeitem">homepage.</a> <br>Here are the steps on how to purchase Supreme items manually:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Open the categories of the items you are going for in separate tabs.</li>
				</ol>
				<img class="pictures" src="img/supremetabs.png" title="Example Supreme tabs" alt="A picture of Supreme Tabs in a Browser.">
				

				<ol start="2">	
					<li>
						Wait until 10:59:45 am <span class="standout">EST</span> (10:59 am and 45 seconds) on drop day (Thursday, always Thursday) to refresh the first tab you are item is in. 
					</li>

					<li>Constantly refresh the tab until the new items load. To check the time by the second, use the website <a href="https://time.is" target="_blank">time.is</a>. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Once the item loads, click it, select your color and size, click the add to cart button, and then click the checkout now button.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					When a Hyped item releases, the Supreme website will be very laggy (lots of slow page loads, network errors, random site glitches, etc.). Supreme's website lags on hype releases because Supreme's servers are getting 10s of millions of requests in a very short period. In such cases, keep refreshing the item category page until your item loads. You can refresh more efficiently using CTRL + R on Windows and Command + R on Mac. If you click the add to cart button, but the item does not add, keep spamming the add to cart button until the item adds. If you click the checkout now button, but your browser does not go to the checkout page, open this link into a new tab: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.supremenewyork.com/checkout">https://www.supremenewyork.com/checkout</a>; it will take you directly to Supreme's checkout page.
				</p>

				<ol start="5" id="threesecwarning">
					<li>
						Now that you are on the checkout screen, just fill in your checkout details as usual.
					</li>
				</ol>

				 <p>
				 	<span class="standout">NOTE:</span> you must be on the checkout page for at least three seconds; otherwise, you might get a card decline error when you hit checkout. The delay is needed because of Supreme's antibot named Ticket. Ticket is what Supreme uses to stop bots from purchasing Supreme items. Ticket will only let you check out if you have been on the Supreme page for at least three seconds. The delay makes it fairer for manual users who can not purchase as fast as bots can. Bots are programs on computers and phones that let people buy Supreme items fast; they can purchase Supreme items in milliseconds. They are used on Hyped items because those items often sell out fast. Because of how slow the Supreme site can be on Hype releases, the process payment button may not respond when you click it. In this scenario, spam-click the process payment button until it responds and processes your order. <span class="standout">No!</span> You will not buy more than one of your item if you spam click the process payment button. Why? Remember, as we said in our <a href="home.html#determinesupremeitem">Determining which item(s) to buy</a> paragraph, we stated that Supreme only allows you to buy one style per item. So Supreme will not allow you to buy more than one of your item, so spam-click as much as possible!
				</p>
					

				<h2>How to buy Supreme with Autofill</h2>
				<p>
					Purchasing Supreme with Autofill is similar to purchasing manually, only faster. Autofill can only be used on desktop.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						You can install the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk">Chrome</a> extension called Autofill. Or, install the <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autofill-quantum/">Firefox</a> version.
					</li>

					<li>
						Add something to your cart and goto the Supreme Checkout page. 
					</li>
				</ol>
					<p>
						<span class="standout">WARNING:</span> do not hit checkout. The purpose of adding this item to your cart is to set up Autofill, as Autofill can only be set up on the checkout page. Fill in your real checkout details; the information you put in now will be the information that will get auto-filled on the day of the release. <br>Next, we will set up Autofill delay:
					</p>
				

				<ol start="4"> 
					<li>
						Right-click the lightning bolt icon in the top right of your browser and click on Add rules for this page. Then type in Supreme and click save. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Right-click the lightning bolt icon again and click options. 
					</li>
					<li>
						After that, click  on "other stuff." 
					</li>

					<li>
						Click the checkmark next to "autofill delay" and slide the bar until it says "3 sec".
					</li>

				</ol>

				<p>
					If you are unsure why you need to set a delay of three seconds, remember that Supreme requires you to be on the checkout page for three seconds to combat bots.

					Now that you are finished setting up autofill, test it out. Add something to your cart and click checkout. <span class="standout">REMINDER:</span> do not click process payment as this is just a test. Below is an example of me buying Supreme using autofill; notice the delay.
